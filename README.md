# pyedtools-control

pyedtools-control is a Python-based toolkit for teaching control systems. It
provides canonical models, controller design helpers, simulation utilities, and
convenient plotting functions built on top of `python-control` and
`matplotlib`.

Features include:

- Pre-built models: mass-spring-damper, DC motor, inverted pendulum
- Controller helpers: PID (with Zieglerâ€“Nichols), lead/lag, LQR and observer
  design
- Simulation wrappers for step, impulse and general forced responses
- Plotting utilities for step, Bode, Nyquist and root locus
